    <h2>Jaden Young</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Jaden and I am majoring in Computer Science. I currently live with my wife and we love to do things like play video games and hang out with friends.</p>
    <p>I just finished work building a new web project from scratch with a company called EMS Logik. Working there we used php along with a MySQL database to create a product for hundreds of customers.</p>
    <p>I love playing Dungeongs and Dragons as well as Magic the Gathering. I have been in a group with a bunch of nerd friends for years and we love playing DND every week.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to revisit the basics of web development and see if there is anything I can learn to help me progress in my career</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am; 2 And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world; -D&C 93:1-2</p>
